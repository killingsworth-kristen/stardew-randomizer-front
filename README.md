A website to help create extra challenges in your Stardew valley Perfection Journey by randomizing the order you complete goals.

## Usage

Everything is saved to the browser. If you clear your site data/local storage, then your data will be erased. There is no login, or server connection. 

### Starting a New Save

Once you start a new save you will be presented with a variety of options. After you have set up your initial configuration, you will be prompted to preview your goals where it will give you an opportunity to enable/disable goals from the master list. Additionally, you will be able to create your own custom goals at this time. Once you are satisfied with your configuration, press the save configuration button to finish creating your save. 

### Using the Randomizer

Click the "Generate a New Goal" to generate a goal. Once you have completed that goal, click the "Complete Goal" button and it will be added to your counter and progress percentage. Once all goals have been completed, a "credit sequence" will start which will show you the total time it took for you to complete your save, as well as how long each individual task took. Additional features like being able to export this summary may or may not be addeed at a later date. 

## Credits

This idea was 100% inspired by [ArgonMatrix ](https://www.youtube.com/@ArgonMatrix) on YouTube who created the original version of this Randomizer as a [Google Sheet/Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eu1PWh9xQ46SOiqoCPrO1E9AzS56V-u0KHSYXiY568s/edit). You should also check out his livestreams of his randomizer playthrough. I thought this idea was worth turning into a fully fledged website (and to make it easier to use for people who may or may not be familiar with Google sheets). Plus it opened up opportunities to add other features like a credit sequence after you complete all goals which sums up your randomizer experience (i.e. how long it took to complete each goal). Because I knew a lot of ArgonMatrix's watchers had already started runs using the original Google Sheet, I made it a goal to be able to import the CSV files from runs people may have already started (of course this will impact their summary at the end, but otherwise they don't have to start their randomizer over).
